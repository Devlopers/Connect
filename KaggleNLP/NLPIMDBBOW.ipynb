    "## Creating Features from a Bag of Words (Using scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our training reviews tidied up, how do we convert them to some kind of numeric representation for machine learning? One common approach is called a Bag of Words. The Bag of Words model learns a vocabulary from all of the documents, then models each document by counting the number of times each word appears. For example, consider the following two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: \"The cat sat on the hat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2: \"The dog ate the cat and the hat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "From these two sentences, our vocabulary is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "\n",
    "To get our bags of words, we count the number of times each word occurs in each sentence. In Sentence 1, \"the\" appears twice, and \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", and \"hat\" each appear once, so the feature vector for Sentence 1 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: { 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 }\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the features for Sentence 2 are: { 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the IMDB data, we have a very large number of reviews, which will give us a large vocabulary. To limit the size of the feature vectors, we should choose some maximum vocabulary size. Below, we use the 5000 most frequent words (remembering that stop words have already been removed).\n",

    "We'll be using the feature_extraction module from scikit-learn to create bag-of-words features. "
